# Case_study_Bank_Marketing


Data Set Information:
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a European banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. Information about a predictive model currently being used by the bank is also included. The dataset contains 41188 records with 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
